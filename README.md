# ðŸ§© Color Matching Memory Game ðŸ§©

 Color matching memory game (concentration)
 This game you can play by yourself. 
 Memory Game or Concentration is a color-matching memory game where you match two same colors until you match the entire board of 16 tiles
 Background Information: I have an aunt who forgets a lot, so I thought this game could help her
 also I know of people dealing with dementia and memory games are supposed to help them.
 
 # Step1: Initialize Game
 -Initialize grid(e.g., 4 x4 grid with 16 tiles)
 -DEFINE colors =( [List of color values, with each color duplicated to form pairs] e.g., ["red","red", "blue", "blue", ...])
 -SHUFFLE the list of colors randomly
 -CREATE cards array to hold each card with color value and state (face down)/ Assign each color from the shuffled list to a tile on the grid

# Step 2. Initialize Game State (Set up Game State)
- Set all tiles as "hidden"
- Set total pairs to total number of unique color pairs (e.g., 8 pairs in a 4 X4 grid)
-  DEFINE flipped Cards as an empty list
-  DEFINE matchedPairs = 0
-  DEFINE totalPairs = number of unique colors in colors list

# Step 3: Game Loop
-  While matchedPairs < totalPairs
- WAIT for player to CLICK a card

# Step 4: On Card Click
- FUNCTION handleCardClick(card or Function handleEvent)
- If the card is already flipped or matched
- RETURN (ignore click)
- END IF
- FLIP card face up
- ADD card to flippedCards

# Step 5: Check for Match if Two Cards are flipped
- IF Length of flippedCards = 2
- Define firstCard = flippedCards[0]
- Define secondCard = flippedCards[1]

- If firstCard.color = secondCard.color
- Cards match
-  SET both firstCard and secondCard as "matched"
- INCREMENT matchedPairs by 1

# Step 6: Check for Game End
- IF matchedPairs = totalPairs
- DISPLAY "You Win!" message
 - BREAK the game loop
- END IF
- ELSE
- No match; reset after delay
 - WAIT for 1 second
- FLIP firstCard and secondCard face down
 - CLEAR flippedCardd
 - END IF
- END IF
- END FUNCTION
- END WHILE

 # Step 7: Restart Option
 - FUNCTION restartGame() or Function resetGame
 - RESET matchedPairs to 0
 - Clear and shuffle colors
 - REINITIALIZE cards and display them face down
 - END FUNCTION
 - END MemoryGAme or resetGame to play again

Explanation of Key Parts
Game Initialization: Creates the color pairs, shuffles them and sets up the game board with all cards face down.
Game State Tracking: Uses flippedCards to store two temporarily clicked cards and matchedPairs to keep track of matched pairs.
Matching Logic: Compares the color values of two cards; if they match, they stay flipped up, otherwise, they flip back down after a short delay.
Win Condition: Ends the game when all pairs are matched, displaying a winning message.
Restart Option: Resets the game state and shuffles the cards, allowing the player to start a new game.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- DOM

## Future Enhancement
- I would add a set of non-matches so the player can lose, game over; different levels to the game, e.g. complete a 16-tile grid, advance to a 32-tile grid game, and then to a 64-tile grid or have the ability to choose between the number of tiles inside of the game.
